Laravel Installation Guide
This guide will help you install Laravel, a powerful and flexible PHP framework, on your computer.

System Requirements
Before getting started, ensure that your computer meets the following system requirements:

PHP >= 7.4
Composer
Node.js and NPM
MySQL or SQLite
Step 1: Download Composer
To install Laravel, you need Composer. If you haven't installed it yet, download Composer from https://getcomposer.org/ and follow the instructions on the website.

Step 2: Pull Files from the Project.
Step 3: Configure the Environment
Create a new database from the SQL file in the database directory.
Copy the .env.example file to a new file named .env:
bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Open the .env file and configure the database information to match the newly created database:
makefile
Copy code
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=v1
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
Step 4: Run the Application
Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:

Copy code
php artisan serve
At this point, the Laravel server will run on the host and port configured in .env. To change the port, you can use the following command:

css
Copy code
php artisan serve --port=8080
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to view the Laravel application.
